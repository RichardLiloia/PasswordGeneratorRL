# Password Generator Starter Code
This password generator meets the requirements of being able to produce a random collection of characters from the user's choice of length between 8 and 128 characters.  After obtaining the desired password length from the user, it will then give prompts to the user whether or not to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols. This method is the best way of selecting a new password, because the computer will always choose a completely random password, and it offers the flexibility of which types of characters to include in the password. Below are screenshots of the page, and the different prompts it gives along the way.
